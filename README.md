# MyMovie

A movie streaming website I created for the sake of practicing Html, Css and Javascript. It features design patterns recommended by the documentation. It also uses the API "https://www.themoviedb.org/" to keep updated.


It is a work in progress, and my first real project with basic stuffs. Any tips on how to better write the code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated.
